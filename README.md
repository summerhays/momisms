# try2
Tipue search redux

First, replace list.md with column Y of the Momism spreadsheet, pasting between dl and /dl in the <> signs and updating the date at the bottom.
Second, search for column G in the spreadsheet, and simply copy & paste items into  try2/tipuesearch/tipuesearch_content.js under the pages bracket and before the final bracket (comma at the end is fine)
That's it! That's what I call public service :)
